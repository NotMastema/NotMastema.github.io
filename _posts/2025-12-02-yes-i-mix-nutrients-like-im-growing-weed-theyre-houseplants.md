I turned into a plant person by accident, which is how most people become plant people. Nobody wakes up one morning and decides to optimize nutrient ratios for their monstera collection. It happens gradually. First you buy one plant because it looked nice at the store. Then somehow you don't kill it, which gives you false confidence. Then you buy seventeen more plants, build a spreadsheet, and start having opinions about pumice versus perlite.

The thing about plants is they give you permission to slow down in a way that feels productive. I can spend twenty minutes just looking at leaves and mixing solutions and checking if that new growth point is going to be a leaf or just my imagination again. It's meditative, which matters more to me than it probably sounds like it should. I'll be seven years sober this October and plants have been one of the things that helped me get here. I obsess over things, always have, and this is one of those obsessions that stuck around. Coffee and espresso machines are another one but that's for a different post.

The routine of checking substrate moisture and mixing nutrients and adjusting light gives me something to focus on that's not destructive. You put in consistent work and you get consistent results, and in a world where most things feel chaotic and uncontrollable, that's worth a lot.

So here's what I've learned after enough time to accumulate way too many plants and a nutrient routine that I'm fully aware is ridiculous.

## The Substrate Situation

I used to think you just bought potting soil and called it a day. Then I learned that most houseplants, especially the tropical ones everyone wants to collect, evolved climbing trees in rainforests where their roots got air and water but never sat in soggy pockets of death. Store bought potting soil is engineered to hold moisture for convenience, which is the opposite of what these plants want.

Now I mix my own and honestly I just vibe with it. My base lately has been Rosy Soil or Fox Farm Ocean Forest, which are both quality starting points that aren't just compressed peat and sadness. Then I add orchid bark for chunk and air pockets, pumice instead of perlite because pumice doesn't float to the surface and doesn't break down over time, activated charcoal to keep things fresh, horticultural sand for weight and drainage, coco coir chips for moisture retention without compaction, earthworm castings for slow release nutrients, and leca when I want extra aeration.

I switched from perlite to pumice after getting tired of finding little white pieces floating on top every time I watered. Pumice does the same job but it's heavier and it lasts. Also it doesn't create dust clouds when you're mixing substrate in your kitchen at midnight because you got excited about repotting.

For cactus and succulents, which are still teaching me lessons the hard way, I start with Jack's Gritty Mix and add some soil depending on what the plant wants. Some succulents can handle more organic material, others want to live in basically pure grit and pebbles. I'm still figuring this category out because I got lucky with tropicals and that gave me unearned confidence about my abilities with plants that evolved in deserts.

## The Nutrient Shelf That Looks Insane

Before I start I just want to say that yes, I know it's ridiculous. My nutrient feeding routine is what people usually do for growing vegetables in their garden or, let's be honest, marijuana. I find peace in it and I'd like this to be a judgment free zone.

I keep Superthrive Foliage Pro as my base fertilizer for tropicals. It's strong at nine percent nitrogen and all the micronutrients are chelated, which means the plant can access them instead of them just sitting in the soil doing nothing. Then there's GH CALiMAGic for calcium and magnesium, Superthrive Pro-Tekt for silica, which has to go in first or it causes precipitation issues that turn your nutrient solution into a science experiment.

I also keep Clonex Clone Solution for when I'm propagating or a plant just went through something traumatic like being repotted or divided. I use it at five to ten milliliters per liter depending on root development. I used to think more was better but that's not how chemistry works.

Then there's the microbial stuff. Azos for nitrogen fixing bacteria, Root Excelurator and Tribus for beneficial microbes that help with nutrient uptake and root health. I mix these fresh every time I water because if you let them sit in a jug they go anaerobic and smell like a crime scene. The key is keeping your stable nutrients in a pre-mix that you can store, and only adding the living stuff right before you use it.

For cactus and succulents I just use Schultz Cactus Plus 2-7-7 and avoid getting fancy. They want less nitrogen and more phosphorus and potassium, and they'll punish you with root rot if you overdo it.

I mix everything according to a schedule I built that splits nutrients into a Pre-Mix and an Add-Later. Silica goes in first, then calcium and magnesium, then base nutrients, then pH adjustment to get it between 5.5 and 6.0 for tropicals, and finally the biologicals last so they don't get destroyed by pH swings. This sounds complicated but after you do it a few times it becomes automatic.

## The Plants I'm Growing

I have two monsteras, a Thai Constellation and a Jungle Mint, that I'm about to chop and start over. We had a spider mite infestation that I'll have to write a separate post about because it's its own nightmare, and these two got hit the hardest. Chopping them back feels like admitting defeat but sometimes you have to scorched earth a problem before it spreads to everything else.

I keep alocasias in my IKEA grow cabinet along with plants I recently got from tissue culture. Alocasias are dramatic and they'll throw tantrums by going dormant if they don't like something you did. They're also beautiful when they're happy, pushing out huge leaves that unfurl like they're trying to win a performance art competition. TC plants start delicate so I keep them in controlled conditions with grow lights until they're strong enough to handle the chaos of being out in the open with the rest of the collection. I can talk about my grow light setup and the cabinet in more detail in another post.

I've also got anthuriums, philodendrons, and a whole lineup of cactus and succulents that I'm still learning how to not kill through misguided kindness.

## The Part Where I Admit I Got Lucky

I didn't have to struggle much in the beginning, which probably made me overconfident. I killed a few plants but most of them survived my early incompetence. I never dealt with pests until the recent spider mite situation, which means I got years of easy growth before reality caught up.

The one plant I definitely killed was a Calathea. If you go on Reddit people hate these things with a passion that borders on personal vendetta. You'll see comments like they will take any excuse to die and that calathea will be dead in a month unless you unlock the power of witchcraft and so did you have to sacrifice your firstborn or something, I offered my younger sister as a sacrifice to the calathea gods and mine still died. The internet is unified in its hatred of calatheas and I understand why now. I will never own another one. Life is too short to fight with a plant that's determined to be unhappy no matter what you do.

I've also never had a fern, which based on what I've read means I'm dodging a similar bullet. Ferns seem to operate on the same chaos energy as calatheas where they want humidity and consistent moisture but also they want to punish you for trying to provide those things.

## Why I Track Everything

I keep a spreadsheet because my memory is unreliable and my plant collection grew faster than my ability to remember what I did to which plant when. Now I track nutrient doses, pH readings, repot dates, substrate mixes, and any problems that come up.

This isn't about being obsessive, though I won't pretend I'm not a little obsessive. It's about removing guesswork. When a plant starts acting weird I can look back and see what changed. The data tells me what worked and what didn't, and it helps me stay consistent, which matters more than having the perfect nutrient ratio.

## The Part That Makes It Worth It

Watching a new leaf unfurl on a Thai Constellation never gets old, even if I'm about to chop the whole thing back. Neither does seeing an anthurium throw up a new flower spike or an alocasia push out a leaf that's twice the size of the last one.

Plant care becomes this rhythm of checking substrate moisture and mixing nutrients and adjusting light and dealing with the occasional pest invasion. Each plant wants something slightly different and over time you learn to read what they're telling you. It's not mystical, it's just pattern recognition, but it feels satisfying in a way that most hobbies don't.

Plus at the end of the day I have a house full of plants that look good and aren't dead, minus the two monsteras I'm about to murder for their own good and that one calathea that had it coming. Progress is progress.
