## About Me

I am Rafael. I work in tech and spend most of my free time with my dogs Zeus and Odin, playing guitar, taking care of my plants, trying new hardware setups, or gaming. I like learning, building, and experimenting. This site is a place for my projects, notes, and whatever else I feel like sharing.
